// Exercise 14: True and False Tests

// Part 1: Comparison Operators

/* Equal

   In JavaScript you can test the equality of two varibles by using "==" (Double Equals)
   or "===" (Triple Equals).

   Think of == as "could be equal"
   Think of === as "definitely equal"

   For Example:

   1 == '1'
   True

   1 === '1'
   False

   '' == 0 
   True

   '' === 0 
   False

   When using == JS will let you compare things that are seemingly different like integer 1
   and a string that contains '1'. 

   When using === JS will hold you to strict requirements that both sides must be absolutely
   identical in order to be true.
*/

/* Not Equal

    You can test whether two things are not equal by using "!=" and "!==". 

    Think of != as "could or could not be equal"
    Think of !== as "definitely not equal"

    For Example:

    1 != '1'
    False

    1 !== '1'
    True

    '' != 0
    False

    '' !== 0
    True
*/

/* Greater, Less than, Equal

    You can test whether things are greater than, less than, or even greater than or equal to
    or less than or equal to using the following comparison operators:

    Think of > as "Greater than"
    Think of < as "Less than"
    Think of >= as "Greater than or equal to"
    Think of <= as "Less than or equal to"

// Part 2: Logic Operators

/*  Logic operators take the result of two or more tests as in (x != y) and enable you to 
    compare them. 

    The "&&" operator takes care of 'and' comparisons. 

    For Example:

    q == 2 && k == 9 

    ^ This can be read as: "is q equal to 2 and is k equal to 9?" If both sides of the operator
    are true, then this will result in a true statement.

    The "||" operator takes care of 'or' comparisons. 

    For Example:

    m == 2 || r == 5

    ^ This can be read as: "is m equal to 2 or is r equal to 5?" 

    The "!" takes care of 'not' comparisons. This operator will invert the truth of anything.

    There is a comprehensive guide for operators at the following website:
